# Early Network Capture Implementation

## Overview
The Echo extension now captures network requests as soon as DevTools opens, even before the Echo tab is clicked. This ensures no requests are missed.

## How It Works

1. **devtools.js** starts listening to `chrome.devtools.network.onRequestFinished` immediately when DevTools opens
2. Requests are stored in a `bufferedRequests` array (max 500 requests)
3. When the Echo panel is opened, these buffered requests are passed to panel.js
4. Panel.js processes the buffered requests through the normal pipeline

## Key Changes

### devtools.js
- Added network listener that runs immediately
- Created buffering system with 500 request limit
- Stores minimal request data + raw request for later processing
- Makes buffered requests available to panel via `window.bufferedRequests`

### panel.js  
- Checks for `window.bufferedRequests` on DOM load
- Processes each buffered request using `processNetworkRequest(request, true)`
- The `true` flag indicates it's from the buffer (prevents UI flashing)
- Clears buffer after processing

## Testing

1. Open test-early-capture.html
2. Click "Make 5 Test Requests Before Opening Echo"
3. Then open the Echo tab in DevTools
4. All 5 requests should appear immediately

## Benefits
- No missed requests
- Better debugging experience
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Minimal performance impact (max 500 requests buffered)
