# Echo DevTools Extension - Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. Pretty-Printed JSON Copy ✅

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed Response Body tab to copy JSON with pretty printing (2-space indentation)
- Fixed Request Body tab to copy JSON with pretty printing
- All other copy operations were already using pretty printing

**Files Modified:**
- `/chrome-extension/panel.js` - Updated copy handlers in `showResponseTab` and `showPayloadTab` functions

### 2. Advanced Search/Filter System ✅

**Features Added:**
- Field-specific search syntax (method:POST, status:404, url:api, etc.)
- Numeric comparison operators for time (time:>1000)
- Header search capability (header:authorization)
- Response body content search (response:error)
- Search hints dropdown with examples
- Backward compatible with simple text searches

**Search Syntax Supported:**
```
method:POST         - Exact HTTP method match
status:404          - Exact status code match
url:api             - URL contains "api"
domain:example.com  - Exact domain match
time:>1000          - Response time > 1000ms
header:auth         - Has header containing "auth"
response:error      - Response body contains "error"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/chrome-extension/panel.js` - Added RequestQueryParser class and updated filter logic
- `/chrome-extension/panel.html` - Added search hints UI and updated styles

### 3. Multi-Term JSON Search ✅

**Features Added:**
- Space-separated multiple search terms
- Filter mode: Shows lines matching ANY search term
- Highlight mode: Highlights ALL matching terms
- Maintains existing functionality for single terms

**Example:**
- Search: "userId email" - Finds lines containing either "userId" OR "email"
- Both filter and highlight modes support multiple terms

**Files Modified:**
- `/chrome-extension/panel.js` - Enhanced `performSearch`, `performFilterSearch`, and `performHighlightSearch` functions

## Testing Recommendations

### Pretty Print JSON
1. Make network requests that return JSON
2. Go to Response tab and click Copy button
3. Paste and verify JSON is nicely formatted
4. Test with non-JSON responses (should copy as-is)
5. Test Request Body tab for POST/PUT requests

### Advanced Search
1. Test each search type:
   - `method:GET` - Should show only GET requests
   - `status:200` - Should show only 200 responses
   - `url:api` - Should show requests with "api" in URL
   - `time:>500` - Should show slow requests
   - `header:content-type` - Should show requests with that header
2. Test backward compatibility with simple searches
3. Test search hints dropdown appears/disappears correctly
4. Click on hints to auto-fill search input

### JSON Multi-Search
1. Open a request with JSON response
2. In Response/Payload tabs, search for multiple terms: "user email"
3. Test Filter mode - lines with either term should be visible
4. Test Highlight mode - both terms should be highlighted
5. Navigate between matches with arrow buttons

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 2 - Logical Operators
- Add support for AND/OR/NOT operators
- Example: `method:POST AND url:login`

### Phase 3 - Complex Queries
- Add parentheses support for grouping
- Example: `(status:404 OR status:500) AND method:GET`

### Phase 4 - Advanced JSON Search
- Path-based search: `user.profile.email`
- Value type filters: `:string`, `:number>100`
- Array search: `items[].id`

### Phase 5 - Performance & UX
- Query history/saved searches
- Virtual scrolling for large request lists
- Web Worker for complex filtering
- Export filtered results

## Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Performance should be good for typical usage (< 1000 requests)
- The implementation follows the phased approach from the design document
- Code is structured to make future enhancements straightforward
